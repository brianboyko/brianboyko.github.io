Howdy - I'm sorry I haven't been blogging quite as much as I was hoping, but I've spent the past two weeks face down in code, completing pre-course assignments for the MakerSquare curriculum. 

It is very clear to me that I'm not going to be able to give the site - and you - the attention that you deserve while I'm attending MakerSquare. I also think that it might be better to revisit this idea after graduation, where not only can I build a better website but I may have more connections in the tech industry. For that reason, I've decided to call an end to the first campaign at $2,486 and 35 individual donors.  <!-- break -->

If you donate at this time, that money will still go to help someone else through code-camp, though I won't be using that money to pay for my own tuition. However, I would recommend waiting until I can set up a full 501(c)3 scholarship to do so.

Don't get me wrong - this was an experiment, and any experiment that you get data from is a success. I think I know what I need to do to make this a sustainable scholarship in the future. 

So, where does this leave us?  Well:

* At $2,486 and 14.6% of the goal raised, my "payback" contribution will be 2.65% of my first year's salary or a minimum of $2,610, whichever is higher. 

* I'm going to need to change the name of this site to "You sent this guy to code camp."

* I need to start writing some nice thank-you notes. 

Thank you for everything you've done for me. Now, the hard part begins.
