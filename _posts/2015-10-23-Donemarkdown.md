Today is my last day at MakerSquare -- and the last day of 11 hour days and mental exhaustion.  Time to start blogging again.  I want to start by showing you something I'm proud of having worked on: Digiquiz.

I couldn't have done this without the help of my thesis teammates, Peter Do and Juan Sierra.  Both of them are great developers and I'm glad I went through this with them. 

Here's our group photo.
