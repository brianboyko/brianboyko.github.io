* [Javascript (and Node.js) Continues To Eat The World](https://medium.com/presence-product-group/javascript-and-node-js-continue-to-eat-the-world-d41918a0615b#.rksyh6keg) - Dale Knauss

* [Pair Programming](https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack/pair-programming-8cfbf2dc4d00#.oj0j22a5v) - Fagner Brack

* [Preact with Redux](https://hashnode.com/post/preact-with-redux-and-react-router-cit04gxwy0jxg8k53wodpyl3m) - Hashnode
  * Preact is a slimmed down React-like that works with pretty much all of React's code and syntax.  I like React, and it already is way less of a loadbear than Angular, but those considering switching to Mithryl for the performance gain might want to check out this version. 

* [Testing in React and Redux](http://silvenon.com/testing-react-and-redux-pt3/)

* [Node-ChakraCore - Time Travel Debugging.](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore/blob/debugging-ttd-preview/README.md) 
  * It's (supposedly) like debugging where you set a breakpoint -- only instead of going forward step by step from that breakpoint, you can go backwards in your code!  Early stages, but worth a look-see. 

* [The Ultimate Introduction To ReactJS - Building React from Scratch (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTHCwUdGFkc&feature=share)
  * How cool is this? You can see exactly how ReactJS was put together and how we got from the world of JQuery and Angular to today!
