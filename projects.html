                  <p>The problem: Student Enagement</p>
                  <p>Teachers today have an impossible problem: keeping students engaged while preparing them adequately for common core standardized testing. Traditional "edutainment" games (Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego, et. al.) are usually solo endeavors and teach only what the software has programmed. </P>
                  <p>We wanted a system that: A) Allowed the whole class to get involved, B) Allowed the teacher to specify or amend curriculum. </p>
                  DigiQuiz is a mobile-enabled, real-time question-and-answer platform that keeps students engage in class through interactive educational gameplay. (In other words, it plays Jeopardy). </p>
                  <p>Teachers control the game from a device or laptop, while students can buzz in.  Teachers can then see who buzzed in first. Students can also leave live feedback on how difficult they found the question, giving them real-time data into what subjects the class needs the most review on.</p>

                      <LI><strong>Database: MongoDB</strong><BR>
                      While our data was highly relational, the flexibility of MongoDB allowed us to rapidly iterate and develop new features. </LI>
                      <LI><strong>Routing: Express.js</strong><BR>
                      Express.js fit well for both our RESTful database API calls and serving up views. </LI>
                      <LI><strong>Websockets: Socket.IO</strong><BR>
                      We used standard jQuery AJAX/API calls to the database but for actually serving that data in real time to a specific subset of users, Socket.IO was the most powerful and flexible solution we found.</LI>
                      <LI><strong>View: React.js</strong><BR>
                      Because we envisioned this as something students would use on mobile devices (with limited bandwidth requirements) we wanted to use a VirtualDOM system to cut down on the rendering overhead on older mobile devices. </LI>

                  <p><em>Legacy Project</em></p>
                  <p>This was a legacy project - we were given a half-developed greenfield project from another team, and we were asked to add features</p>
                  <p>The Tech Stack: MEAN Stack</p>
                  <p>Features Added</p>
                    <UL>
                      <LI><strong>Custom Criteria for Feedback</strong><BR>
                      The original app had nine categories hard-coded into the system, we added the ability to add and remove categories both stored on the database and displayed via the data visualization library, D3.JS</LI>
                      <LI><strong>Comments Form</strong><BR>
                      We allowed for evaluators to leave custom feedback for the form.</LI>
                      <LI><strong>Responsive Redesign</strong><BR>
                      We improved the UI by creating a responsive design (including the use of modals) with Bootstrap.css/Bootstrap.js</LI>
