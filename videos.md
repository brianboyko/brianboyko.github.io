Steve Wozniak for Mayday.US
{% endcapture %}
{% capture woz_desc %}
Steve Wozniak, co-found of Apple, endorses Mayday.US, the citizen-funded, kick-started SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs. In this video he explains how, in order to preserve Internet freedom, we have to fight against corruption at it's root - the way that politicians are forced to raise money from wealthy, elite, funders.

I did the animation, but Woz came up with his own script.
